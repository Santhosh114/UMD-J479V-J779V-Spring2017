You might examine other variables or charting options for instance. **Your insight should be easily stated in a sentence or two, or captured by a chart that could be similarly explained in a caption.** Try to think like a journalist: Spend some time trying to make your insight something that could be a headline for a news article - that could entail some type of surprising result, social inequity, or implication for education policy. Be sure to show your entire code and process for deriving your insight. "
